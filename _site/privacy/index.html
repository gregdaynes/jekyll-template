3 ways to specify Touch Icons for iOS

1) No link tag:
   it is possible to skip the <link> tags to touch images completely.
   iOS will automatically search the root of the website for the icons
   the order of the search is:

     apple-touch-icon-57x57.png
     apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png
     apple-touch-icon.png

2) Single Icon:
   iOS will resize 152px * 152px icon for all devices

3) Multiple Icon:
   serve iOS muliple icons - this allows for the designer to make sure
   certain icons will looks great at all sizes.
